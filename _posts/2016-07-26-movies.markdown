I just want to cut the "What's your favorite movie?" conversation. Here is my [Imdb ratings](http://www.imdb.com/user/ur20846269/ratings?start=1&view=detail&sort=release_date_us:asc&defaults=1&scb=0.03685502278286523)
I am cruel while rating movies. But I suggest you to try at least one movie from my top 10.


Ah, also you can see my watchlist. [www.imdb.com/user/ur20846269/watchlist](http://www.imdb.com/user/ur20846269/watchlist)
I've already watched some of them but some movies deserves a second and third watch. 

You also may discover some new movies from [my movie blog](http://my-shots.tumblr.com/)
