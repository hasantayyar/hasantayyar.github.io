I've started ketogenic diet and I will log my experiences here for a month

- Day 1, Day2: I took no carbs. Only cheese and eggs. At the end of day 2 I feel a little dizzy. I will increase salt consume.
- Day 3,4,5: I felt dizzy at day 3 and 4. I messed up with this diet at Day 5. I ate almost everything made with flour. I will reset whole process from Day 6.
- Many days after : I've to find a different type of diet.
