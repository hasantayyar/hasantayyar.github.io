One of Dario's early work  "Canzonissima" is featured satirical songs and sketches depicting the lives of the working classes under the pressure of politics, industrialisation and economics.
It's often censored.

This is a nice example of his works, a play for the TV: [Ci Ragiono E Canto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GO-eOTNIL4M)

I liked the acting so much the play but also the music. So I continued listeing other records for other plays by Dario: [The New Italian Canzoniere - Ci Ragiono E Canto 2 (Dario Fo 1966)
