> Dialectical logic was founded by German famous philosopher F. Hegel, but it has not been laid on mathematics for a
long time. In this paper author explains the dialectical logic pure mathematically, and shows that the classic formal logic,
its mathematical expression is Boolean algebra(includes multiple value system), is a special case from dialectical logic,
and the true-valued function for dialectical logic is a continuous function valued on closed interval and defined on time-space axes system. 
The Aristotle three laws of formal logic are expanded into expression of dialectical
logic, and Russell paradox is expanded into the case of multiple order. Some new theorems for Boolean operators and the
matrix expression for De Morganâ€™s theorem of multiple variables dialectical logic are given. At the end of the paper,
linear or nonlinear dialectical logic are defined and analysis properties of dialectical logic true-valued function are
pointed.
