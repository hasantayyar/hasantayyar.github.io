I recently discovered this album "The Routes of Slavery" by Jordi Saval. It is more like a project.

Many different artists contributed. It's a multilinugual album. The booklet and the details fo the project is published during a live event [PDF](http://images.lincolncenter.org/image/upload/v1510078133/yfhyrdykntjgiereio7s.pdf)

The album is on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/5iRJeFmgDETMCRPFP0Y1pp?si=NTKxp6KDReqy9lEu4j8xWw) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvkU6gyxTYI&list=OLAK5uy_kxyFq9kNmqxaT5X2cCk5B3G-nWei4jbEg)
